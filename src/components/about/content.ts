export const title = `About my work and experience`;

export const info = `Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase projects built with a
powerful combination of cutting-edge technologies such as React,
Django Ninja, tanstack-query, React Hook Form, Zod, Zustand, and
Tailwind CSS. By leveraging these technologies together, I can provide
efficient, high-performing, and visually appealing solutions for a
wide range of challenges. Here are some advantages and reasons why
using these technologies together is a smart choice: Efficiency:
Utilizing tanstack-query for data fetching, React Hook Form for form
management, and Zod for data validation streamlines development and
ensures a more efficient workflow. This combination allows for quick
and seamless handling of data between front-end and back-end.
Simplicity: Zustand simplifies global state management with a minimal
API, making it easier to manage application state and reducing the
complexity of managing state across components. Reliability: By
incorporating Zod for data validation, I ensure that only valid data
is processed and displayed, increasing the reliability and integrity
of the application. Customizability: Tailwind CSS offers a highly
customizable and responsive design system, allowing for quick and easy
styling of components and enhancing the visual appeal of the projects.
Overall, using these technologies together not only enhances the
functionality and performance of the applications but also simplifies
development, ensures data integrity, and provides a visually appealing
user experience. Explore my portfolio to see firsthand how this
technology stack brings these advantages to life in various projects.`;

export const bio = `As a web developer, I contributed to the development of a digital
certificate generation system for Segurm√°tica, utilizing Sequelize's
ORM capabilities and Typescript to define data models and interact with the database.
With Express.js, I crafted RESTful APIs and implemented controllers to
handle HTTP requests and responses. I designed a secure authentication
flow on the server-side, leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and
implementing custom authentication logic using middleware functions in
Express.js. For client-side development, I employed React's state
management and event-driven architecture to create a user-friendly
interface. I leveraged React Hook Form for form state management,
TanStack Query for data fetching, and Zod for schema-based data
validation. Additionally, I utilized Zustand for centralized state
management and persist data on localstorage. 
React Router Dom for route configuration and URL
parameterization. Through this project, I gained valuable experience
working with these technologies and improved my understanding of how
to effectively integrate them to deliver a robust and efficient
application.`;
